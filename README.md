## About me

Freshly certified Data Analyst: I obtained <i>Data Analyst Certificate </i> (statistical studies) delivered by ENSAE-ENSAI (Paris), and I'm currently working on <i>Data Science Certificate</i> (Orsys). <br><br>

I'm a compulsive learner. I'm constantly trying to learn something new, be it professionally (long live the MOOCs;) ) or personally related.<br><br>

Besides data analysis and data science I also enjoy books, travelling and occasionally I do some painting.<br><br>
